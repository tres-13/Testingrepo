Throughout the past year, I've made sure to always meet the deadlines for all tasks and special projects, even those outside my usual workload. This includes emergency updates for our software and hardware, which are crucial for keeping everything running smoothly. When assignments come in, whether through a chat in Microsoft Teams or an email, I make it a priority to understand what needs to be done and by when. My goal has always been to not just meet the deadlines but to try and get things done even earlier if possible. Achieving a 95% on-time rate is important to me, but so is making sure everything is done accurately and with high quality. Balancing everyday tasks with these special assignments means staying organized and always keeping an eye on what’s coming up next, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. This way, our team can avoid any unexpected issues and keep our systems reliable and effective.

Maintaining a professional and friendly attitude has always been a priority for me, especially being a part of the Workstation Management Team (WMT). I make sure to always be polite and respectful in all my interactions, whether it’s with our team internally or with external partners, to uphold a positive image of WMT and MSB. Quick, accurate, and helpful advice is something I always aim to provide to anyone I work with. Building and maintaining good working relationships with everyone, inside and outside of HRC, is crucial for achieving our goals and supporting our mission. I always keep my supervisor and relevant team members updated on ongoing projects and any potential issues, ensuring we can solve problems effectively and before they negatively impact our work. My proactive approach has successfully kept stakeholder complaints to a minimum, ensuring smooth and cooperative operations throughout the period.

Even though my role doesn't focus on security, following all security guidelines and rules is always a priority for me. When security events are issued, I carefully assess their impact and ensure corrective actions, especially regarding workstation vulnerabilities, are implemented promptly. I’m dedicated to making sure that any assessments are documented thoroughly and accurately, and shared on time with the relevant people or groups. This ensures that any IT security issues are addressed and corrected as quickly as possible. I always aim to meet the timelines set for each security event, whether that’s the mitigation date or an HRC approved date, to maintain a secure and stable work environment. Striving for perfect compliance, my goal is to prevent any interruptions to our mission or any oversights in corrective actions, ensuring our operations remain safe and reliable at all times.

In my work preparing software packages for the RSN enterprise, I've used my skills in Microsoft C# and PowerShell to create reliable and effective solutions, even with limited supervision. My process involves carefully analyzing and understanding the customer's requirements, then designing, coding, testing, and implementing the necessary software, all within the set deadlines. Having worked on various projects, including those involving Power Apps development, I always aim to create code that meets our mission requirements with the highest quality and least issues possible. My goal is to have no more than one code defect in our production releases per rating period, ensuring our software is trustworthy and meets the needs of our team and organization consistently. This focused and straightforward approach helps to keep our projects on track and our software running smoothly. In addition to this I have had the priveledge of being apart or our AI development and research team here at WMT looking at new and exciting ways we may be able to use AI to integrate into not only existing RSN applications but new and upcoming ones as well to help modernize the Army. This brings new code languages such as python and julia to the mix as well that could be useful and benficial in more ways than just for developing AI. 

Even though I don’t usually work directly with customers, I always make sure to fully understand and meet the requirements for every software project that comes my way, whether from my supervisor or fellow developers. When I get a new project, I carefully look at all the requirements and explore all possible solutions, recommending the best way forward. I thoroughly check and choose the right software and hardware to make sure they meet the requirements and our established standards. I make it a point to keep leadership informed with various options to meet project requirements within set timelines and standards. My goal is always to ensure that I miss no more than one customer requirement during each rating period, making sure our software meets, if not exceeds, the expected standards and contributes positively to our project outcomes and the success of our organization. This approach ensures that all projects are carried out effectively and align with both immediate needs and broader organizational goals.
